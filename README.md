# Real Estate Price Prediction Website

## Project Overview
This data science project is a real estate price prediction website. The project consists of three main components:

1. **Model Building**: Built a model using sklearn and linear regression with the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com.
2. **Python Flask Server**: Developed a Python Flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests.
3. **Web Interface**: Created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows users to enter home square footage, the number of bedrooms, etc. The website calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
